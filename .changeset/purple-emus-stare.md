# ðŸŽ‰ xstate v5 support ðŸŽ‰

This release finally updates `xstate-component-tree` to work with modern versions of xstate. No major API changes within the library itself, mostly v4 to v5 stuff like [always sending `{ type : "EVENT" }`](https://stately.ai/docs/migration#actorsend-no-longer-accepts-string-types).
